Image::Magick::Thumbnail::PDF - make thumbnail of a page in a pdf document
==========================================================================


I wanted a quick sub to make a thumbnail of a pdf.
The goal of this module is to make a quick thumbnail of a page in a pdf.

They give the viewer an idea of what is inside the document, but is not 
meant as a replacement for the actual file.

This module is a quick interface to a predetermined use of convert.
There are a ton of ways to do this via ImageMagick and convert, etc. I 
took what seemed to make most sense from various suggestions/ideas, and 
slapped this together. If you think something can be better, please 
contact leocharre at cpan dot org.
